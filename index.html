      <p>The <em>Human Freedom Index</em> (HFI) is the most comprehensive freedom index so far created for a globally meaningful
        set of countries. The HFI covers 162 countries for 2016, the most recent year for which
        sufficient data are available and it includes three countries Belarus, Iraq, and Sudan
        that were added this year. The index ranks countries beginning in 2008, the earliest year for
        which a robust enough index could be produced.</p>

      <p>On a scale of 0 to 10, where 10 represents more freedom, the average human freedom rating
        for 162 countries in 2016 was 6.89. Among countries included in this year’s and last year’s
        report, the level of freedom decreased slightly (−0.01) compared with 2015, with 63 countries
        increasing their ratings and 87 decreasing. Since 2008, the level of global freedom has also
        decreased slightly (−0.06), with 56 countries in the index increasing their ratings and 81 decreasing.</p>

        <p>The jurisdictions that took the top 10 places, in order, were New Zealand, Switzerland,
          Hong Kong, Australia, Canada, the Netherlands and Denmark (tied in 6th place), Ireland
          and the United Kingdom (tied in 8th place), and Finland, Norway, and Taiwan (tied in 10th place).</p>

               <p>The correlation between the personal and economic freedom ratings was 0.63 for 2016.
                 Nations in the top quartile of personal freedom saw a higher economic freedom score compared
                 to the bottomquartile nations. </p>

            <div>
               <p>Some countries ranked consistently high in the human freedom subindexes,
                 including Switzerland and New Zealand, which ranked in the top 10 in both personal
                 and economic freedom. By contrast, some countries that ranked high on personal freedom rank
                 significantly lower in economic freedom. For example, Sweden ranked 3rd in personal
                 freedom but 43rd in economic freedom; Slovenia ranked 23rd in personal freedom but 71st in
                 economic freedom; and Argentina ranked in 42nd place in personal freedom but 160th in economic freedom.</p>

            <div>
               <p>Similarly, some countries that ranked high on economic freedom found themselves significantly
                 lower in personal freedom. For example, Singapore ranked in 2nd place in economic freedom while
                 ranking 62nd in personal freedom; the United Arab Emirates ranked 37th in economic freedom but 149th
                 in personal freedom; and Qatar ranked 38th in economic freedom but 134th in personal freedom. </p>

            <div class = "intro"><p>Does human freedom matter for development? There is a strong relationship between
              the level of freedom and income. Figure 2 shows that countries in the freest quartile enjoy
              significantly greater average per capita income ($39,249) than those in the other quartiles.
              On average, the freest countries in the world have a much higher per capita income than those that
              are less free. The data, of course, do not establish
              a means of causation or even the direction of causation and provide only a snapshot in time.
              But the data suggest the need to explore the links between freedom and development further and
              to test the contribution of freedom to prosperity and other indicators of human well-being, as has
              been done in the case of policies and institutions supportive of economic freedom.</p>

            <div class = "intro"><p>Regional levels of freedom vary widely. The average ratings on the Human Freedom
              Index by region were highest for North America (Canada and the United States), Western Europe,
              and Oceania and were lowest for South Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, and the Middle East and North Africa.
              The largest improvement in freedom since 2015 occurred in North America (0.03), while the largest deterioration
              occurred in Eastern Europe (−0.08). In comparison, the largest improvement in freedom since 2008 occurred
              in East Asia (0.11) and sub-Saharan Africa (0.11), while the largest deteriorations in freedom occurred
              in the Caucasus and Central Asia (−0.25) and the Middle East and North Africa (−0.58), the least free region.
              The regions that had greater overall levels of freedom also tended to exhibit higher ratings in personal freedom
              relative to economic freedom than did the less free. That is consistent with the findings in Figure 1, that the countries
              with high levels ofpersonal freedom also have high levels of economic freedom.</p>
